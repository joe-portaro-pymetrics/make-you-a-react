# make-you-a-react

Story time!  Was following along with the [build your own react tutorial](https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/).  It's very well done - I especially like how the code is added/removed/changed as you scroll along.  I wanted to actually type the code and see it run (and change the code to see how it reacts or add features).  It's not too hard to fire up a text editor and make a HTML and JS file and link'em together.  But, the tutorial also relied on some Babel magic and that's where I got tripped up.  

So, I made this.  To start clone this repo and open the directory with terminal.  Then run `npm install` and `npm start`

A new reloadable browswer tab should (I hope) open.  Make your changes in the `src/react.js` file and watch them reload in the tab.
